## ‚ùì About
Many times popular tools can damage the USB device, such as using the DD function in Rufus.
There are disk partitioning tools, but we personally tested 90% of them and they generate errors or exceptions because they cannot make a proper repair for situations of this type. On the other hand, there are tools that promise to repair such errors, but they are paid tools.
To save you a headache, we developed this software that does everything quickly and easily, without so many twists and turns or complex processes.
